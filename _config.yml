  Hi, <b>Quvi</b> here. 
  I am a systems research intern at <a href="https://orderlab.io">OrderLab</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>. 
  My research interests lie in the intersection of Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Compilers. 
  My current research focuses on reliable kernel extensibility. I am a recent graduate from the Department
  of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)</a>.
  
  Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position in OS/Architecture/Compilers.

            A Framework for Enhancing Flexibility and Runtime Safety of eBPF Programs
          </b></h4><br>

            eBPF is an emerging technology to extend kernel functionalities safely. 
            However, its verifier's overly conservative reasoning often leads to 
            rejections of valid programs, forcing developers to adopt cumbersome workarounds. In addition,
            its static-only analysis sometimes misses safety violations in
            complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we present
            ePass, a lightweight, in-kernel framework that integrates selective runtime checks into eBPF programs.
            ePass introduces a compact Intermediate Representation
            (IR) and associated APIs which allow developers to add flexible passes 
            for instrumenting various checks to tackle different
            verification challenges. These passes work with the existing
            static verifier, allowing rejected but well-behaved programs
            to run. ePass additionally adds runtime checks to ensure the
            program's behavior is consistent with the verifier's expectations. 
            ePASS allows system administrators to pre-configure
            passes to establish flexible, trustworthy policies globally. Our
            evaluation shows that it simplifies the adoption of advanced
            features (e.g., termination check) while maintaining reliability,
            with minimal overhead.

            LELANTE: LEveraging LLM for Automated ANdroid Test Execution

          Automated mobile application testing faces two critical challenges: 
            (1) executing natural language test specifications without manual scripting, 
            and (2) reliably verifying test outcomes across diverse application states. 
            Existing approaches often require specialized scripting languages or 
            rely on fragile record-and-replay mechanisms, which increase maintenance 
            costs and reduce verification reliability. To address these issues, 
            we introduce LELANTE, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) 
            to automate both execution and verification of natural language test cases. 
            LELANTE employs a two-stage pipeline: an LLM interprets and executes test 
            steps via interaction with the device's graphical user interface (GUI), 
            while another language model validates execution outcomes against expected conditions. 
            In experiments across 390 test cases spanning 10 popular Android applications, 
            LELANTE achieved an <b>85%</b> execution success rate and an <b>85%</b> verification 
            accuracy using open-source models on standard hardware. 
            These results show that LLMs can effectively bridge the gap between natural language 
            test specifications and automated test execution, 
            making mobile testing more accessible without compromising reliability.

            DistilAgent: Distilling Agentic Capabilities from Large Language Models for Long-Horizon UI Navigation
          </b></h4><br>

          <p style="text-align: center">
            <image align="center" src="images/DistilAgent.png" alt="DistilAgent" height="300"/>

          Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous 
          agents in diverse environments, but their agentic capabilities are 
          strongly contingent on their parameter count and context window size. 
          While closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude are already quite capable, 
          smaller open-source models struggle with autonomous UI navigation tasks. 
          To bridge this gap, we propose DistilAgent, a novel framework that 
          distills the capabilities of long-context closed-source LLMs into smaller models
          , significantly improving their performance in autonomous UI navigation. 
          DistilAgent incorporates three key components: task discretization to 
          break down long-horizon tasks into smaller sub-tasks that fit within the 
          context window of smaller models, explicit reasoning enforcement to ensure 
          the LLM reasons about grounding and the current state of the environment, 
          and exploration encouragement to prompt the LLM to explore the UI when 
          required actions are not immediately available on the current screen. 
          Our results demonstrate that DistilAgent improves the task completion rate 
          of GPT4 from 50% to 90%. We collected AutoNav1K - a synthetic dataset of 
          1,000 GPT4 task executions using DistilAgent. After finetuning on AutoNav1K, 
          the task completion rate of LLaMA-3.1-8B improved from 0% to 60%. DistilAgent 
          showcases the potential for distilling the agentic capabilities of large, 
          closed-source LLMs into smaller models, democratizing access to high-performance 
          autonomous UI navigation.
